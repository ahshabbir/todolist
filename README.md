This project is a basic implementation of a todolist website, with ability to add/remove/finish tasks. 
You add add tasks by typing in the name of the task in the text box, then either pressing enter or pressing the add button. 
Mark the task done by clicking on the task row, and if you messed up, you can put it back by clicking on that task again.
If the window clutters up with finished tasks, simply hit the clear done tasks button.
